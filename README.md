# MDWave

A simple converter for [Moonwave](https://github.com/evaera/moonwave) JSON output files.
This project was created due to myself wanting a more customizable way to use Moonwave.

It was initially meant as purely a proof-of-concept, so code quality is not the best.

## Credits

A large portion of the code used in this project came directly from [Moonwave](https://github.com/evaera/moonwave), such as the extractor and a large amount of the processing code for the JSON files.
