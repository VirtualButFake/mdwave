# 1.3.0
Reworked API Reference organization - now runs through tags instead of through the configuration option `classSections`, done to make it easier to configure classes without having to go to the config, and allowing you to specify a group of a class right in the code, which is more in-line with how Moonwave works.

Added isRoot to Docs.
